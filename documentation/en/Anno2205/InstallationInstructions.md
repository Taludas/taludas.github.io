1. Download the latest release from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ieKBR05wj9faAGwwROIFxkLX25pu4hqw/view?usp=sharing).

2. Open your Anno 2205 installation directory.
> Easiest way is through the game launcher of your choice. For Ubisoft Connect follow this path: Library -> Anno 2205 -> Manage (top right corner with the gear icon) -> Properties -> Installation -> Open folder
3. Make sure you have no other mods installed for the game. If you are not sure, use the "verify files" option of your game launcher.

4. Copy the "data" folder from the downloaded zip-file to the Anno 2205 installation directory. Overwrite existing files, if prompted to do so.

5. Change the folder to your Windows "Documents" folder (Standard path is: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents). Go into the "Anno 2205" folder. If there is none, make sure you have started the game once after installation.

6. Inside the "Anno 2205" folder, follow the path "Anno 2205\config\engine.ini". Open the engine.ini file with an editor program. Editor, Notepad++ or VSCode are good programs to do this.

7. Search for the `"PreferLocalFiles"` entry. Change the value behind it from `"false"` to `"true"`. If it has been changed already, you don't need to do it. Make sure to save the edited .ini file on exit.

8. Read the [FAQ](/en/Anno2205/FAQ.md) and the [Known Issues List](/en/Anno2205/KnownIssues.md)

9. You are good to go!
> You will notice if the installation has been successful when the usual epilepsy warning has been changed to a custom text. Enjoy the mod!
