## Quality of Life Improvements
- You can now open the ingame console by pressing Left Shift + F1. Some commands can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno2205/mods/1?tab=description). While having basic autocomplete, notice that the console is not tolerant to spelling errors or incorrectly formatted arguments. The game will freeze in those cases.
- All cutscene videos can be skipped by pressing escape. Same goes for Ubisoft logo and intro movie. Fade out duration has been shortened.
- Several NPC reminder messages have been removed, since they are quite intrusive and come in to short intervals for my liking:

    1. Docks Reminder: John Rafferty does not remind you to upgrade your ships anymore.
    2. Arctic Custodians: Hovard Young will not remind you that "This building plot is at your disposal" every time you build a mine or a coastal building in the Arctic.
    3. Event Sectors: removed starting/reminder messages from the Mysterious Lady, trader Jorgensen, John Rafferty, Hovard Young
    4. Voting: removed start/reminder messages from the Mysterious Lady (voting is broken anyways...)
    5. Orbital Station: removed the annoying notifications every time the space shuttle launches with a new batch of Astronauts (why in the first place would you need to know this?!) as well as the regular message if you float Expertise.
    6. Tundra: removed "welcome back" message from Esther Nylund every time you enter the sector after initial unlock.
    7. Share Market: removed most basic AI starting and winning notifications.

- Changed World Market Route Durations from 2 hours to 12 hours (world market price adjustments are broken anyways...), reminder notification for route expiration shortened to 5 minutes before ending, expiration offer timer is unchanged at 2 minutes before expiration.
- Increase the storage capacity (999) and production rate (1/min) of all rare resource generators (Sector Quest rewards)
