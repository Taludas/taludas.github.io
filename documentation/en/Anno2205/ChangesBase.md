### <img src="../../_media/icons/icon_needs.png" height="24" /> Consumption
   - Changed the balance of the product consumption multiplier per level of difficulty for residences to better reflect the more complex production chains and changes to the output of certain factories:
    |**<img src="../../_media/icons/icon_needs.png" height="16" /> Consumption multiplier**|**Plenty**|**Medium**|**Sparse**|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |<div align=center>Mod</div>|<div align=center>1.00</div>|<div align=center>1.25</div>|<div align=center>1.50</div>|
    |<div align=center>Vanilla</div>|<div align=center>1.00|<div align=center>1.50</div>|<div align=center>2.0</div>|

   - Changed consumption values of many needs for all population levels (haven't fully figured out how the actual consumption is calculated from the values in population_balancing.xml, use the ingame statistics menu)

### <img src="../../_media/icons/icon_earth_goods_round.png" height="24" /> Earth
   - Exchanged Drink and Food need position in the UI for Worker tier to match the new setup for Operators.
   - Changed Construction costs and build time for all Monumental Bridges:

    |---|---|---|---|
    |<div align=center>1</div>|10 minutes|25t/min Superalloys <br> 750 workforce|150000 credits <br> 100 Graphene|
    |<div align=center>2</div>|20 minutes|50t/min Superalloys <br> 1500 workforce|300000 credits <br> 125 Graphene|
   - Lowered the required balance for the very last quest of the sector project in Walbruck Basin from +50k to +25k as the original one was quite hard to achieve in higher difficulty runs before having >150k Investors.
   - Residences on Earth now cost credits to upgrade (normal/complex): upgrade to Operator 5/10, upgrade to Executive 25/100, upgrade to Investor 250/1000, upgrade to Synth 10000 (building material cost changed to 10 Biopolymers, 6 Construct-o-Bots, 10 Superalloys, 8 Fusion Power Cells, 8 Androids, 10 Iridium, 5 of each rare resource)
   - Windparks produce base 125 Energy (was 50), making them more competitive in later stages of the game
   - Desalination Plant: Changed Output from 5t/min to 8t/min
   - Output of Feldspar and Cobalt Mines changed to 10 t/min (was 5 t/min)
   - Corporation headquarter can now support 50 modules (was 30)
   - Corporation headquarter modules changed Maintenance modifier to +10% (was +5%). Output modifier is now +5% for Services and +10 Urbanisation

### <img src="../../_media/icons/icon_polar_goods_round.png" height="24" /> Arctic

### <img src="../../_media/icons/icon_moon_goods_round.png" height="24" /> Moon
  - Added Construct-o-Bot build material costs to all buildings on the Moon from unlocking the interorbital spaceport

### <img src="../../_media/icons/icon_arctic_custodians.png" height="24" /> Tundra
   - Residences in the Tundra now cost credits to upgrade: upgrade to Field Researcher 250
   - Changed first steps of the Questline in Tundra Region to reflect changes in population needs and Technology Nexus. Added 10 Petrochemicals as a reward for settling the first Ecologists in Tundra to make upgrading the spaceport there possible without extra work.
   - Construction costs and time have been changed for all Tundra Pumps. They now require Aluminium, Superalloys, Titanium or Titanium Plating in addition to Construct-o-Bots. Times have been shortened to 3 Minutes each, but input requirements increased. Finalization costs have been altered to include Graphene, Petrochemicals or Magnetite for the first step. Maintenance costs for the second stage have been increased and include workforce now. Time has been shortened to 6 minutes. Finalization costs for the second stage have been changed to include credits and reduce demand on Petrochemicals.
   - Changed trade route vehicles in the Tundra to "normal" cargo ships from Temperate sectors. This reduces costs for trade route maintenance especially in the early game.
