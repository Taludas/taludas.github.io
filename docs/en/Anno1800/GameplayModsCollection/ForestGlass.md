Also known as Waldglas in German, refers to a type of glass that was produced during the late medieval and early modern periods in Europe, particularly in the regions of Germany and Bohemia. It is characterized by its distinct green color and often exhibits a slightly crude or uneven texture.

Forest glass was primarily used for making drinking vessels, bottles, and window panes. Its production was a significant industry in the forested areas where it thrived, hence the name 'forest glass'.

Ingredients:
- Quartz sand
- wood ash to provide potash (K2CO3) as flux.

The green color of forest glass is attributed to impurities present in the raw materials, particularly iron oxide from the sand and plant ashes used. These impurities, combined with the specific firing conditions in the forest glass production, resulted in the distinctive green hue.

To compensate the increased resource input, there are several buffs in place:
- a standard 10% production boost on the glasshouse.
- a near field buff coming from the glasshouses and boosting potash and woodcutter buildings in its vicinity (+50% Productivity).
- a return buff from potash and woodcutter buildings to increase productivity of the glasshouse (+10% Productivity per building).

This ensures a good synergy effect, if the buildings are built in close range, as it is historically correct.

This mod will automatically modify other mods using the vanilla glassworks/adding new production chains using the glass chain.
