Build a Zoo in the Arctic. Display local animals that are suited for the rough climate. Get unique bonuses from these sets.

#### Features:
* Build a snowy Zoo in the Arctic Region.
* Display 9 different animals, adopted to the cold in unique enclosures.
* Get unique buffs and a special new airship from completing the 2 available sets.
* Extra filter for cultural items at Arctic kontors.

If you already collected the animal items and build the Hangar monument, it is likely that you'll have to move the hangar by a few tiles to get the buffs working properly and/or reequip the set items.

P.S.: Please don't bring other animals to the arctic, they will suffer a very horrible cold death :P
