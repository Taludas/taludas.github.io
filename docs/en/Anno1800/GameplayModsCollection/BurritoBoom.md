Craving a flavor-packed fiesta for your taste buds? Look no further than our sizzling, mouthwatering burritos!

Picture this: tender, marinated meat, grilled to perfection and paired with creamy, vibrant guacamole, all nestled together in the blanket of a warm, soft tortilla.

Your citizens have stumbled upon an old family recipe, using regional ingredients, which together taste so good, that people from all over the globe come to your colony to taste this flavor paradise. The new ingredients are:
- Meat (uses 'Cattles need to be butcherd' Mod if present)
- Guacamole made from fresh Avocado and fine-tuned with hot spices (requires LoL or Seeds of Change/Hacienda).
- Tortillas made from corn, extracted using an old technique called Nixtamalization, which requires pot ash.

In return for your increased efforts, more people will come to your town due to the enormous popularity of the new recipe (+5 inhabitants for Obrero and Artista residences from Burritos, standard plus 50% Productivity for Burrito Maker).

Needs either the Land of Lions or Seeds of Change DLC for acquisition of spices. Avocado Fertility can be acquired by starting a new game, using the items available at Isabel Sarmento, using the Research Institute or using the Hacienda Farm.
