This little mod changes the not very accurate farm fields of the Orchid Farm to one that actually could make sense. Orchids are usually parasitic plants, growing on trees. So them growing in plain farming soil is not really close to reality. Also the usage of a Tractor to harvest the Orchids is as sensitive as the use of a chainsaw on those precious plants.

Therefore, this mod changes the one tile fields to actual Greenhouses, reducing the number of field module needed, but also getting rid of the tractor boost.

**Warning**: Before installing, make sure your Orchid Farms (or at least their fields) have been deleted. Otherwise you might get funny clipping issues and non removable fences which previously surrounded your fields!

If you use the Hacienda Overhaul Mod, note that the Orchid Fields for the Hacienda Farm will not change, due to the mechanic behind the recipe building.
