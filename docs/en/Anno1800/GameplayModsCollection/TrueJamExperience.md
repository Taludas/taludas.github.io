Ever wondered why Jam grows directly on trees in Anno 1800?

Because they chose the simple way. But I don't like it the simple way. So I took the idea and assets from Lrds42 and made a separat mod that only adds a new Jam Production Chain based on Cherries, Sugar and Glas.

You'll need 1t of Cherries/min, 0.5t of Sugar and Glass/min to produce 1t Jam/min.

The Jam manufactory is now a Multifactory so we can expand it in the future with different Jam flavours.

To get a nice boost on the new production facility there is a special item: 'Marlene - Mother of Marmelades'. She is buyable at Eli.

Compatibility between Lordys, Kurilas and my mod is provided by [Kurila](https://github.com/Qurila)! Big Thank you for that!
