After the introduction of the first form of modern era Plastics in the DLC 'High Life', the Production Chain for Souvenirs felt a little lackluster. Obviously the use of Campher Wax and Cotton resembled the ingredients of celluloid plastic. But why use this anymore after the introduction of the celluloid ware with High Life?

To spice things up a little, I reimagened the Souvenirs to be made of Celluloid for the stand, Gold for the snowflakes and model inside and Glass for the bulb.

You can now also sell the Souvenirs to your Tourists not only in the Hotels directly but also in little Souvenir Stands around the place. This reduces overall sells in the Hotels (-50% Need reduction), gives extra money and attracts a lot of new tourists (+50 Tourists from Souvenirs, +5% visit chance on the Tourist Peer)!

If you use iMYA you can choose between two variants of the mod. One with expansive souvenirs made form gold in a artisan workshop (High Life Souvenirs) and the other with cheap ones made in an assembly line out of brass (Low Life Souvenirs). You can also activate both sub-mods to get the full experience.
