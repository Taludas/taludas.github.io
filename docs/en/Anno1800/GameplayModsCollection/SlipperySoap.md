Historically soap was the first modern product used for cleaning of body and cloths. It was made by boiling animal fat in an alkaline solution over several hours. In Anno this process is poorly represented.

Therefore I included Potash into the production chain as a early version of the alkaline additive. Potash can be obtained by burning wood and extracting the remains with water.

Hope this new soap recipe makes it a little bit more realistic for you!
