Follow Vasco Oliveira into the lands of his former colonial administration! After his humiliating defeat in Crown Falls and his rehabilitation in the "Season of Silver", he now seeks revenge on his former master: King Joao of La Corona. As the previous events have taken their toll on his constitution, he asks you for help: accept his invitation and find a way to the forgotten colony settlements of Mayabeque (Pronounced "Majabek"). Support him in his endeavour to lead the diminished colonial power to new glory! But be careful, your journey may not go unnoticed and not everyone will support your plans for the lands of Mayabeque...

A DLC sized mod that adds a second New World session to the game, including a 15-quest long story with two different ends, a converted Crown Falls continental island and some other fancy stuff like two new Monuments with unique effects, two new Traders and another new way to generate more 'arctic gas' and 'bear furs'.

## Features

The main addition of "Colossus of the New World" is a new region called Mayabeque, unlocked after completing a series of Quest and an Expedition available once you house 1 Investor. The Expedition also features one completely custom Expedition Event. (If you want to explore all decisions of the Event, bring a medicore boat and not the best items, otherwise you might be able to skip the event on the first decisions. Also save before the Event to explore all endings.)

It is a second New World region and consists of a mixture of different island sizes with one of them being unique, it is the big continental island named "Santa Cruz", located in the eastern part of the region. Some of you may identify Crown Falls, but it has been fully converted to the New World setting with adapted textures and props. The session also features a set of five unique coast-free islands known from the "Clash of Couriers" Scenario. These cliff islands can only be settled via Airship (if you want to utilise these Cliff islands to their full potential, you will need the "Empires of the Skies" DLC enabled to settle them) and feature some rare ressources, you will surely try to exploit to provide your Investors with their sophisticated needs. To support your local economy, two new traders have established warehouses in the new region. Otherwise the Gameplay in this region, including available population, buildings, goods, resources and fertilities etc. is the same as in the rest of the New World.

The DLC includes a 15-quest long storyline which surrounds the build-up of the new colonial power, assisted by a well known character of another DLC. The questline has two unique endings, so to explore all possibilites of the story, you may want to start a second game to discover which one suits your playstyle best. While following the questline you will get the option to build up one of two versions of a unique monument on Santa Cruz island, either benefiting your military and trading fleet or boosting your Tourism Empire to a new level (To complete this part of the Questline you will need the "New World Rising" and "Tourist Season" DLCs and the Mod "New World Tourism" enabled.)

**TL:DR**
The Mod adds the following elements:

- Adds a second New World Session called "Mayabeque"
- 15-quest long and unique storyline surrounding the discovery and build-up of the session featuring two different endings: You decide what you will make of the region!
- Special highlight of the Session is the retextured and converted Crown Falls continental island called "Santa Cruz".
- You choose between one of two versions of the new monument buildable on Santa Cruz, featuring two different mechanics: Either a Military Academy or the Santa Cruz Grand Hotel.
- Two new Traders in the region
- Set of coast-free cliff islands featuring new slots to extract "arctic gas" and hunt for precious Jaguar pelts. Those can be shipped to the Old World to provide your Investor's "Bear fur" need.
