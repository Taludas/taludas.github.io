This Mod bypasses some hardcoded parts of Anno 1800 to redesign the UI of the Hacienda and make it possible to use copies of the Hacienda in other sessions of the game without it looking out of place.

To use it, just place this mod as a submod of your main mod. Important: Only include as is, do not modify shared resources in your mod. You risk breaking other mods otherwise.

You are now able to create a Hacienda clone with a clean and neutral Interface.
