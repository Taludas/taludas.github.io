You enjoy it thinking about Investors having to hump up a new billiard table to their apartment in the skyscraper every day? Then this mod is just for you. Replaces the Icon for Billiard Tables with on more suited for a sturdy and heavy Billiard Table.

In my opinion, the Billiard Table Icon from the Highlife DLC is a little underwhelming. If you have played at a tournament graded table once, you will see that these legs are to small and not sturdy enough to be a good quality billiard table. Since there is an alternative Icon file in the game assets, which looks way better in my opinion, I wrote this little mod to just replace the icon. Nothing else was changed gameplay wise!
