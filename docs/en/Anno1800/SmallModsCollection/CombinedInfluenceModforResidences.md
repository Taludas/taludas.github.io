This mod allows for customized Amounts of Influence gained from residences in all sessions. The tweaking can be done via [iMYA](CombinedInfluenceModforResidences) or by manual asset modification. Standard Values are vanilla. You can also customize the amount of Influence gained for Engineers from the Palace Edict and the amount gained for Obreros/Artistas from the Hacienda Decree. Notice that the values are absolute and won't get influenced by the game setting concerning the amount of Influence gained by residences!
