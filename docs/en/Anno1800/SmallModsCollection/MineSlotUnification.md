This little mod allows you to build every mine on any slot available. There is one uniform slot for all mines. Therefore you can no longer build mines directly from clicking on the slot. You have to find the mine in the build menu first!

Same goes for clay pits. There is now one slot called Opencast Resource Deposit on which all opencast mines will fit.

After DLC12, I exchanged all new mine slots in the New World (Bauxite, Helium, Iron, Minerals) with Gold slots. If you use an existing savegame, the way I implemented it means, that on Manola, the slots are uniform in Icons and slot type, but if you click on, it doesn't highlight all mines. But I don't think this is a big issue, since all mines are suited for all slots. If you start a new game, this issue is not present.

**WARNING:** The activation of this mod in a savegame means, that this savegame now relays on the presence of the mod. If you remove mid playthrough, all mine slots will become iron or gold depending on the region and all opencast resource mines become clay slots. The mines may no longer fit the slot, so you cannot build them any longer. So watch out! If you want to remove the mod, load a savegame from before loading this mod for the first time! Make a save before with a clear name so you can always remember it!
