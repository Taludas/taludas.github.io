**The activation of the mod can be a little bothersome. If you just start the game with the mod activated, you might find the new portraits locked with 'Unlocked by ""' as a comment on how to get them. What you need to do to unlock them is to load up an existing savegame once. Build a few houses, switch sessions, play for a few minutes. If you come back to the title screen afterwards, you'll find the portraits unlocked and selectable for use.**

With this mod, ALL portraits previously not available for selection can now be used by you for character creation. No need to pay your preciously earned Golden Tickets from the scenarios for them, if you can have it for free.
