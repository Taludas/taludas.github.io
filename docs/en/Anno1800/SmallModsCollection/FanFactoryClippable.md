This mod is fixing the issue present since GU17 concerning the Ventilator/Fan Factory. The building is sporting a 0.5 tile offset, that made it impossible to be clipped, since the center of the building was off-grid and disrupted the usual clipping mechanic.

If you install this mod and have already built some Fan Factories in your savegame, you will have some graphical issues where street might clip through the building. This can be easily solved by grabbing the building up with the Move-Tool. When placing the building down again, the graphical issue is fixed.
