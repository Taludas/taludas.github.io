A very simple mod that adds a buff to all buildings with a maintenance cost (GUID=368) that reduces the chance of an explosion by 1000%. So even if you have other buffs or items active in your factory that increase the risk of an explosion, it is very unlikely that it will ever happen again. This mod reduces the annoyance of going through all the sessions to restore the ruins. Have fun and above all, safe building!
