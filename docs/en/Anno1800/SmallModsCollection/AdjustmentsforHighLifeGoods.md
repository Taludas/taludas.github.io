This mod is not really made by request, but by an idea from Wiesl in the Ubisoft Discussion Forum. His post inspired me to adjust some of the highlife goods and features for better integration with tourist season and other DLC.

Detailed changes:
- add Cognac and Mezcal to Beer Festival Buff
- add Cognac and Mezcal to Harvest Festival
- add Cognac and Mezcal to City Carneval
- add Cognac and Mezcal to Anarchy Festival
- add Cognac Production Chain to all alcohol production chains
- redesigned Buffs for cafe, bar and Iron Tower recipes to include cognac and biscuits and even the amount of buffed goods
- add Cognac and Mezcal to Armagnac Bottles
- add Cognac Manufactory to all drink productions
- add Biscuit Assembly Line to all food productions
- add all Orchards to Origin of Mankind of and Miombo Woodlands set buffs
