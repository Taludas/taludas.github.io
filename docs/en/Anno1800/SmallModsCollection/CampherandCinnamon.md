This mod fixes not only the oversight, that camphor and cinnamon orchards use the same tree as graphic asset, but the same tree config as well. So before cinnamon and camphor orchards haven't had their productivity lowered by overlap as much as the other orchards. To fix this, I created a recoloured tree prop with the camphor tree as base. The new tree is a little smaller, the leaves use a darker green colour and the bark is now coloured in a more redish tone. With the tree ready I assigned it to a unused tree config of the NW, so that now cinnamon and camphor orchard overlap properly. The cinnamon tree can be used for the tree brush as well.

In addition, the orchards are now located in a separate construction category inside the Jornalero build menu to reduce the entries for better overall visibility. Furthermore, I reduced the internal storage of all orchards from 10 to 4 to reduce the enormous range they have in vanilla which creates all sorts of logistical problems.
