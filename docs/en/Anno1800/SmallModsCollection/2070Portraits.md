**The activation of the mod can be a little bothersome. If you just start the game with the mod activated, you might find the new portraits locked with 'Unlocked by ""' as a comment on how to get them. What you need to do to unlock them is to load up an existing savegame once. Build a few houses, switch sessions, play for a few minutes. If you come back to the title screen afterwards, you'll find the portraits unlocked and selectable for use.**

With this mod, some of the iconic people from Anno 2070 return as time travellers to Anno 1800 for you to play. Bring the Industrial Revolution to a hold with Seamus Green, using only clean energy like the Dam or Nates Windmill or build yourself an oil imperium and exploit every available oil and gas deposit as Vadim Sokov, the oil baron!
