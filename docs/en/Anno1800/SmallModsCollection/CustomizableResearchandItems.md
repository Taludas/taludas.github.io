This mod is combining one of the most anticipated QoL Updates since the release of Anno 1800 concerning Item gameplay - at least for me - with a fully customizable Research Institute. This mod is meant to be tweaked via [iModYourAnno Mod Manager](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases). Otherwise you'll get vanilla values for all the features concerning the Research Institute.

You can now stack every item in the game apart from Quest Items (which are usually unique) to 99 pieces a stack. No longer maintaining a whole fleet to buy a hand full of items from Eli. This should be a huge time saver in long term. Just buy one of each item you want to mass-purchase, then afterwards all other items will be greyed out because of no space left inside your ship. Only the selected items will be buyable and stack inside your ship.

You can modify nearly every value involved with the Research Institute. From maximum Queue Size, over custom research time and cost config, cost limit for item research, till number of permits granted per research. Best have a look inside iMYA and play around with the numbers to get the full experience.
You can also customize the Item Transfer Module in every session. Frustrated over the limit of 24 items? No problem, with this mod you can increase it to whatever number you like. You can get rid of the timer until the item is available, too! Includes support for Arctic and Enbesa Modules, if you use those mods.
This mod is (not necessarily) incompatible with all other mods that in any way change the features of the research institute (time, cost, output, etc.) I marked as incompatible the mods I found at Nexus that have a modinfo.json. But there are enough mods that do not have this. So be careful with your mod choice! If you still have some of these mods, my mod will most likely overwrite them, thanks to LoadAfterIds, so don't worry too much!

The little problem which actually isn't one:
With this mod enabled you could potentially exploit the expedition feature of the game, since every item inside the holds of your ship counts towards the success probability of the selected expedition. So you could just load a stack of 6 legendary items and never have problems with the "minigame" again. But as you could have stacked ActionItems like the pirate flags before and no one has done that, I believe in you all, that you use this feature wisely and maturely to only not get crazy over buying items at Eli.
