A mod to ease up the Mail gameplay a little bit:

* Mail can now be loaded and unloaded onto any ship type just like a regular good.
* You can set a minimum stock in the Kontor
* You can now use normal traderoutes via ship or airship to distribute Mail (but not convert it! You still need the Airship routes to convert Local into Regional and Oversea Mail!!!)
* You can assign Mail as exclusive good to load/unload at Airship Platforms.
  1. For this you first need to press "Shift+C" while the Platform is not selected.
  2. Upon selecting the Platform afterwards, you'll find the regular UI of an Advanced Pier.
  3. Choose "Local Mail" from the list. The Platform will now only accept Mail Airship Routes to load/unload there.
  4. Deselect the Platform and press "Shift+C" again to switch back to the normal UI (Thanks to Kurila for providing his shared mod "UI Change" for this feature to work).
