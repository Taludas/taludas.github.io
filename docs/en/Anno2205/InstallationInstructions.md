> **&#x2022; You need to start a new savegame in order to enjoy this mod's content!**
>
> **&#x2022; You need to own all three official DLCs to play this mod!**
>
> **&#x2022; If you want to experience the full effect of Mars' four seasons, it is required that you start your savegame with edited difficulty settings upon game creation: `Calamities=[Seldom, Regular or Frequent]` and `Assignment Time=[Long, Medium or Short]`. The later option influences the length of the Mars Seasons.**
>
> **&#x2022; If you don't want to experience any seasons on Mars, choose the following settings: `Calamities=[Off]` and `Assignment Time=[No Limit]`. This will give you an "infinite" summer on Mars, which has no restrictive effect on the sector.**

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Taludas/Anno2205-NewFrontiers/releases/latest/download/Anno2205_NewFrontiers.zip).

2. Open your Anno 2205 installation directory.
> Easiest way is through the game launcher of your choice. For Ubisoft Connect follow this path: Library -> Anno 2205 -> Manage (top right corner with the gear icon) -> Properties -> Installation -> Open folder
1. Make sure you have no other mods installed for the game. If you are not sure, use the "verify files" option of your game launcher.

2. Copy the "data" folder from the downloaded zip-file to the Anno 2205 installation directory. Overwrite existing files, if prompted to do so.

3. Now you need to open the Windows "Documents" folder (Standard path is: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Documents). Open the "Anno 2205" folder inside. If there is none, make sure you have started the game at least once after installation.

4. Inside the "Anno 2205" folder, follow the path "Anno 2205\config\engine.ini". Open the engine.ini file with an editor program. Editor, Notepad++ or VSCode are good programs to do this.

5. Search for the `"PreferLocalFiles"` entry. Change the value behind it from `"false"` to `"true"`. If it has been changed already, you don't need to do it. Make sure to save the edited .ini file on exit.

6. Read the [FAQ](/en/Anno2205/FAQ.md) and the [Known Issues List](/en/Anno2205/KnownIssues.md)

7. You are good to go!
> You will notice if the installation has been successful when the usual epilepsy warning has been changed to a custom text. Enjoy the mod!
